# pwdgen | https://omiinaya.github.io/pwdgen

This is a secure password generator made using a dynamic HTML webpage, semantic tags, JavaScript, CSS for styling and Bootstrap elements for responsiveness.

The generator should prompt the user to choose from a set of options. (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, numeric characters and password length.) Then create a password based on the chosen criteria once all those conditions are met.

This project is currently hosted on Github pages.
